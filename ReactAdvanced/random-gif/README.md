# random-gifs

This is the project focusing on the use of the customHook and how is it made 

So let's dive a little deep into that please see the code of Random.js and Tag.js component, the code that has been commented in both the components was similar in both the files and to reduce the redundancy we have put that similar code in "useGif.js"

Basically customHook is also a function but it is fixed that it starts with the prefix "use".
Please see the code properly, you will understand very easily yourself the making of the customHook. All the concepts in this project have been previously taught.
